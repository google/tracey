// Package trace defines interfaces, types, and functions that facilitate
// building traces suitable for visualization, analysis, and transformation.
//
// In this package, a Trace is fundamentally collection of Spans, each of which
// has an active interval (e.g., a start and end timestamp), and which have
// causal relationships, or Dependencies, between them.  Additionally, each
// Span comprises a sequence of ElementarySpans: intervals during which
// incoming Dependencies only occur at the start, and outgoing Dependencies
// only occur at the end.  Gaps between neighboring ElementarySpans within a
// parent Span represent suspended, or idle, time, and may be introduced with
// Span.Suspend().
//
// As a special case of inter-Span relationships, this package natively
// supports blocking Call and Return Dependencies, in which one Span (the
// caller) spawns and yields to another (the callee), resuming its execution
// when the callee returns.  This models the ubiquitous blocking-call behavior
// observed in code callstacks, blocking service calls, etc.  Spans with no
// calling parents are RootSpans, and are created at the Trace level.
//
// Additional Dependency types may be user-defined and used with specific Trace
// instances.  Different Dependency types are not treated differently in this
// package, but instead are used to identify and select specific classes of
// Dependencies, for instance when defining Trace transforms.  A Dependency
// must have a single origin endpoint -- a particular Span at a particular
// point within its running duration -- and one or more destination endpoints,
// and it defines, for each destination endpoint, a causal relationship with
// the origin endpoint: the destination endpoint cannot occur until the origin
// endpoint has occurred.  Dependencies are created at the Trace level.
//
// Traces may also define hierarchies of Categories into which RootSpans may
// be placed; when a RootSpan is placed under a Category, all its descendant
// Spans also fall under that Category.  Category hierarchies are generally not
// used for analysis, but are invaluable in visualization, where they can
// reveal the different contexts in which Spans execute.  Category
// HierarchyTypes may be user-defined and used with specific Trace
// implementations, and a single Trace implementation may support many
// HierarchyTypes; under each one, every RootSpan should have exactly one
// parent Category.  For example, a single-system user-mode execution Trace may
// offer CPU, process/thread, and execution-phase HierarchyTypes; switching
// between these in visualization helps users orient themselves in the Trace and
// spot resource contention issues.
//
// ElementarySpans are automatically created and managed by Trace
// implementations: for each Dependency endpoint, the ElementarySpan at that
// endpoint is fissioned into two at the moment of the endpoint, and the
// Dependency is linked with one of the fissioned parts -- if an origin
// endpoint, this Dependency becomes the first fissioned part's outgoing
// Dependency, and if a destination endpoint, this Dependency becomes the
// second fissioned part's incoming Dependency.  A Dependency may not be
// introduced to a Span at a point where that Span is suspended, and a Span
// suspend may not be placed over a Dependency.
//
// The order in which Dependencies are applied matters.  When multiple
// Dependencies are applied to a given Span at the same time, earlier-applied
// Dependencies are causally dependent on later-applied ones (e.g., if an
// outgoing Dependency O is applied to Span S at time T, then an incoming
// Dependency I is applied to Span S at time T, an ElementarySpan beginning
// with I and ending with O will result.)  Generally this doesn't matter, but
// can have an effect during trace transformation.
//
// Similarly, there is tension between the order in which suspends and
// Dependencies are applied to Spans (and hence the flexibility of constructing
// new traces), this library's ability to detect and report problems in the
// trace, and the simplicity of the ElementarySpan decomposition.  For
// example, suppose Span S running from time 0 to 100, into which a suspend
// is applied from 20 to 50, an incoming and outgoing Dependency at time 50,
// and another suspend applied from 50 to 80.  If during this Span's
// construction the suspends are applied before the Dependencies, those
// suspends, though abutting with no Dependencies between them, must not be
// merged, as subsequent Dependencies will be placed between them.  So, this
// library is conservative: it permits zero-duration ElementarySpans, even
// when they have no Dependencies, and does not merge abutting suspends.  This
// maximizes flexibility at the cost of simplicity -- it's possible that, after
// all Dependencies and suspends are added, Spans may contain zero-length
// ElementarySpans with no Dependencies.  To rectify this, after all suspends
// and Dependencies have been applied to a trace, the trace's Simplify method
// can remove such ElementarySpans -- however, invoking Simplify before all
// Dependencies have been added may leave subsequently-added Dependencies no
// place to go.
//
// Trace has four parameterized type arguments:
//   - T any: the type of the temporal dimension of the trace (e.g.,
//     time.Duration or time.Time).  A Comparator implementation with this type
//     must also be provided.
//   - CP fmt.Stringer: the type of Category payloads.  Category payloads
//     provide storage for Category metadata not captured in the interface, such
//     as display name, Category type, and so forth.  Category payloads must
//     implement fmt.Stringer to enable full Category serialization.
//   - SP fmt.Stringer: the type of Span payloads.  Span payloads provide
//     storage for Span metadata not captured in the interface, such as display
//     name, type, and internal structure such as trace events.  Span payloads
//     must implement fmt.Stringer to enable full Span serialization.
//   - DP fmt.Stringer: the type of Dependency payloads.  Dependency payloads
//     provide storage for Dependency metadata beyond type.  Dependency
//     payloads must implement fmt.Stringer to enable full Dependency
//     serialization.
